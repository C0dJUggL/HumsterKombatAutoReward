# HumsterKombatAutoReward
This script allows you to collect Hamster Kombat rewards from different telegram accounts. 
Every 3 hours the script will log into each account and send a report about everything to your telegram bot. 
For everything to work, you need to use an Android emulator, configure all the coordinates for yourself, and also add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID to the script.
